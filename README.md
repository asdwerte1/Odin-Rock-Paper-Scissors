<h1>Rock Paper Scissors - JavaScript Console Game</h1>
<p>A simple rock paper scissors game based in the console for the Odin Project course.</p>
<p>The only concepts to be used within this are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Variables</li>
  <li>Operators</li>
  <li>Conditionals</li>
  <li>Functions</li>
</ul>
<p>as these are all that is covered up to this point in the course - I may then work in further aspects down the line.</p>
<h2>Refelection</h2>
<p>The solution for this is definitly not optimal, but does generally follow the instructions and guide</p>
<p>I may return to this in the future and improve further (time dependent and if I remember!)</p>
